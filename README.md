## ⚡ What is Mortal?  

Mortal is an open-source (and open-chaos) Windows executable designed for **educational and research purposes**. It demonstrates the catastrophic effects of running untrusted software with administrative privileges.  

In short:  
- It **deletes critical system folders** (System32, SysWOW64, Boot).  
- It **forces a reboot** to ensure "clean" results.  
- It is **100% irreversible**.
